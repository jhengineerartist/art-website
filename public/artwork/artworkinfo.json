            "caption": "The charcoal rendering of the Caesar Bust was the capstone project for my first year at The Georgetown Atelier.  This project saw me develop a professional understanding of value hierarchy and the turning of form.  The cast rendering assignment is steeped in the tradition of the atelier system dating back to at least the 19th century and it is a testament to the artist's diligence and patience as these assignments can routinely take over a month to realize. I was expected to pour over every small detail until I realized the final form in an optical and aesthetic perfection.",

After months of training my skills, I was able to construct the figure and turn the form with the careful application of compressed charcoal until an artistic vision of the model emerged and each granule of charcoal felt thoughtful and considered.",

This painting was a three week life room figure painting. I continued to develop my understanding of anatomy from the live models during life room sessions in my second year of atelier training. This was one of the first oil paintings where I was able to fully synthesize the anatomical and value hierarchy lessons from the first year together with the novel paint handling skills I developed in the second year of atelier training.
