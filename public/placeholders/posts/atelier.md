# Learning Realism At Georgetown Atelier

There aren't any shortcuts when it comes to developing your technical skills as an artist; however, you could be forgiven for suspecting an artist of exploiting such a shortcut after seeing the degree of progress they make at an atelier.  The key to progress is the hours of focused study, working from life, and being able to lean on the expertise of your instructor and "borrow their eyes".  If you're curious about becoming a fine artist, especially if you're considering working in the realist tradition, I would highly recommend considering an atelier program.  The time commitment can be prohibitive, but if life's circumstances permit, itâ€™s worth it.

## What is an Atelier?

An atelier is a studio learning environment run by a professional artist.  Often there is a master, and some of the alumni of said master working together to cultivate the skills of fresh artists (or experienced artists coming to atelier to focus on their technique).  The atelier system has been practiced consistently from the Renaissance to the 19th Century, all the way to their present-day resurgence. The throughline is a commitment to technical skill development, working from life, and the studio space where master and student exchange their vision. 

## The Georgetown Atelier

My Atelier was the Georgetown Atelier in Seattle, which is affiliated with Gage Academy. The first year at the atlier focuses entirely on charcoal drawing and fundamentals. The second year builds on those same fundamentals, but the artists are introduced to oil painting in monochromatic black and white, progressing into full color by the end of the year. The final year is when students generally build their portfolio of work, from which they will launch their artistic career.

## Why Choose Oil Painting?

Oil painting is a storied art form that gained prominence during the Renaissance, reached an apex in the 19th Century, and continues to carry its prestige into the present day. The unique properties of oil paints, such as their adjustable drying time, variable translucency, and textural effects allow artists to achieve depth, luminosity, and intricate details in their work. 

At the same time, realist oil paintings have an approachability. The subjects are often more accessible - from the mythological tableau of the Romantics to the cheeky paintings of 20th century illustrators. I think oil painting in the realist tradition gives the audience a wider window into the vision of the artist.

## My Atelier Experience

Attending an atelier is a serious time commitment, and I recommend the full-time experience.  You will have the opportunity to paint from the live model in the mornings, share what you've learned with your fellow student artists at lunch, and then work on studies or portfolio work in the evenings. I would break down the benefits of the Atelier experience like this:

### 1. Expert Instruction

You're going to be working with a master artist who has built a professional reputation and whose body of work inspires you.  There is no substitute for the kind of demos you can get from a master.  The master painter who taught me, Tenaya Sims, is an incredible Imaginative Realist who paints a new vision for mythology.  The figures in his paintings and the quality of the brushwork and light inspired me to attend Georgetown and continue to influence my emerging body of work.

### 2. Emphasis on Fundamentals

In the age of instant gratification, the Georgetown Atelier takes a refreshing approach by focusing on the foundational elements of art. You will start with simple exercises to develop your observational skills, gradually progressing to more complex compositions.  Tried and true classics like the Bargue Plates are used alongside drawing the live model.  Studying constructive anatomy and inorganic objects such as mechanical objects and rocks gives the artist an idea of how to ideate and create novel imagined subjects in their paintings.

### 3. Personalized Learning

Small class sizes at the atelier allow for personalized attention, enabling instructors to understand your strengths and areas that need improvement. This individualized approach ensures that each student receives tailored feedback and guidance.  No one develops at the exact same rate, and everyone has individual strengths and weaknesses.  While I quickly grasped value hierarchy, brushwork and rendering took me more time. Some students will excell quickly with color while for others it will take more time to develop. It really takes an individual approach.

### 4. Immersive Studio Environment

The studio environment at the Georgetown Atelier is designed to foster creativity and concentration. Surrounded by like-minded artists in a supportive community, you'll find yourself inspired to explore new artistic horizons.  I've made friends for life at the atelier program.

### 5. Artistic Critiques

Constructive critiques are an integral part of the learning process at the atelier. Regular feedback sessions with instructors and peers will help you identify areas of growth and encourage you to push the boundaries of your artistic expression. The phrase "borrowing the eyes" of the instructor helps illustrate the idea.  When we are learning, its hard to even understand why the painting or drawing seems "off".  It would take far longer to intuit this just by trial and error or consulting images, than to take some time with the instructor and listen to them break down the reasons why the painting or drawing might be off from the desired goal.

## Conclusion

I feel blessed that relatively early in my artistic journey I entered the Atelier system.  It allowed me to quickly break through some of the stumbling blocks in artistic study to quickly access more interesting, finished work.  While technique will probably always fall short of vision, the atelier system will help get your technique close enough to communicate that vision to your audience.  This is a huge relief when so often we're just worried our paintings will look amateurish or unprofessional.  While I'll always be improving, I can take comfort in the knowledge that I can take pride in my first post-atelier portfolio work.
